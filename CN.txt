-- This is a file summing up various facts and pointers I thought were worth noting in Computer Networks -- 

# Internet is a network of certain computers connected to each other through various processes and protocols. Internet connectivity is made live through various 
  optic fiber cables laid under the ocean that run from country to country. 
  
# There are various topologies in which different devices are connected with each other. For ex:- Bus, Ring, Star, Tree and Mesh. 
  Bus topology is a simple connection of different devices through a single wire line. If connection breaks somwhere, the devices after that point won't work.
  Ring topology is the connection of various devices in a circular ring. For a device to access some other device, it will have to go through all the devices in between
  the devices. 
  Star topology is a centralized network of different devices. One device acts as the central device and controls all the other devices. All the information goes through
  the central device only. 
  Tree topology is the intermix of Bus and Star topology. Various star combinations are conected in a Bus Fashion.
  Mesh topology is an All to All connection of devices where each device is connected with every other device leading to scalability issues.
  
# OSI Model stands for *Open Systems Interconnection* model. This layer is responsible for all the background activity, transportation and recieving of data. 
  OSI Model has 7 layers namely :- Application layer, Presentation layer, Session layer, Transport layer, Network layer, Data Link layer and Physical Layer.
  Application layer :- This is the layer through which users interact with. Ex:- Whatsapp Client, Web Browser. 
  
  
# There is another more practical model for data transmission that is TCP/IP Model and contains only five layers namely Application layer, Transport layer, 
  Network layer, Data Link layer and Physical layer.
