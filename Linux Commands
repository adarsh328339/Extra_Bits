}

{File Permissions:- 
    
    ls -l will show you the file permissions. chmod u or chmod g or chmod g is used to modify the permisiions. u stands for users, g stands 
    for groups and o stands for oters. r stands for read, w for write and x for execute. Ex:- chmod u=rwx , g=rx, o=x upper.txt
    
    A very handy number system incorporates using read = 4, write = 2, and execute = 1. So, doing chmod 547 upper.txt will give (4+1)= read and execute
    permission to users, read permission to groups and 7(4+2+1) = read, write and execute permissions to others. 
    0 stands for no permissions.
    
    chown:- Changes access permissions. Current user is user. Root user is accessed by sudo. Ex:- chown root upper.txt . Now, no one except root user
    sudo can change the permissions or edit the file or chmod the file. 
}

        cases and indicating their line numbers.
